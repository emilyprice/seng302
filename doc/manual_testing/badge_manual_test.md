#Manual Testing for Unlocking and Levelling up Badges
Whenever the requirements for unlocking or levelling up a badge are met, we want to see a
 notification, earn the appropriate amount of experience and see the badge image updated if needed
 on the relevant page(s).


##Test 1: After enabling achieving badges in practice mode, and upon completion of each of the
 following tutors:
- Musical Terms Tutor
- Pitch Comparison Tutor
- Chord Recognition Tutor
- Interval Recognition Tutor
- Chord Spelling Tutor
- Key Signature Tutor
- Diatonic Chords Tutor
- Scale Modes Tutor
- Scale Spelling Tutor

The related badges progress are updated (being Correct Questions, Completed Sessions and 100%
 Sessions).

How the test passed:
1) I started the app, initiated and completed tutoring sessions for each tutor, recording my scores.
2) For each of these tutoring sessions, I was returned to the tutor summary page.
3) I ensured the relevant badges were either unlocked or their progress updated.
4) I ensured the newly updated badges progress was consistent on the user summary page.


##Test 2: Upon meeting unlock criteria of each of the following badges:
- TwinkleTwinkle
- Speedster
- Creative
- Instrument Master

The relevant badge is unlocked.

How the test passed:
1) I started the app and carried out the required actions to unlock the badges, this included:
 - Submitting the command "twinkle" to the transcript
 - Submitting the command "force set tempo 122" to the transcript
 - Navigating to the theme settings page and changing the user theme to an orange colour
 - Navigating to the project settings page and changing the set instrument to Piano 2
2) For each the actions above, I was notified of the unlocking of the relevant badge, awarded
 some amount of experience and the relevant badge was unlocked on the user page.
3) Using a different user account, I ensured that the transcript-unlocked badges updated the user
 page when they were unlocked with the transcript open on the summary page.
