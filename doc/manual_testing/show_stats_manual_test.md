#Manual Testing for Displaying Correct Stats Page
Whenever a tutoring session is completed, we want to display the correct stats page.


##Test 1: Upon completion of each of the following tutors:
- Musical Terms Tutor
- Pitch Comparison Tutor
- Chord Recognition Tutor
- Interval Recognition Tutor
- Chord Spelling Tutor
- Key Signature Tutor
- Diatonic Chords Tutor

The related stats page was displayed.

How the test passed:
1) I initiated a tutoring session for each tutor.
2) For each of these tutoring sessions, I skipped or answered all questions
3) I ensure the opened page matched up with the recently completed tutor, and that the correct element
was selected in the list view.
